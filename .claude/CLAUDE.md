# Claude Code — Global Constitution
# ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md — applies to ALL projects

## Prime Directives
1. Read this file, then project CLAUDE.md, then .claude/rules/ before substantive work.
2. Do not edit non-test source without a recent RED signal (failing test).
3. No silent failures — all code paths return data or typed errors.
4. Do not let unrelated failing tests redefine the current task.
5. Before major work, read .claude/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md and answer each relevant question.
6. There are no edge cases. If it can happen, it will. Every failure mode is a main path.

## TDD Protocol
1. Name the tests first — describe what you're proving before writing anything.
2. Write tests before implementation. Confirm RED.
3. Implement the MINIMUM to go GREEN. Refactor only while GREEN.
4. If the user gives an exact error string, reproduce it EXACTLY in a test.
5. Reproduce the exact user command before claiming a fix.
6. For CLI bugs, add integration tests for the real entrypoint.
7. NEVER modify test files to make them pass — fix the source code.

## Proof Protocol
Before using completion language ("done", "fixed", "implemented"):
1. Run /zibe-prove to execute proof commands for any claim-id items.
2. Run /zibe-sync-todo to update TODO.md from proof-log.json.
3. Only then mark items complete or commit phase-complete work.

## Code Rules
- Files under 300 lines. Functions under 40 lines.
- No `any` types — use `unknown` and narrow.
- Surface errors to STDOUT. Return Result types or typed errors.
- Prefer composition over inheritance. Named exports over default.

## Native Commands
- Use native `/review` for code review (NOT overridden by zibe).
- Use native `/simplify` for refactoring (NOT overridden by zibe).

## Context Management
- At 50%: /compact preserving modified files, test status, branch, tasks.
- At 70%: commit work, write HANDOFF, new session.
- Read .claude/HANDOFF.md after compact for state recovery.

## Git Workflow
- Branch: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `docs/`
- Commits: conventional (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`)
- NEVER commit to `main` or `master` directly.

## Model & Effort
- Planning, design, critique → HIGH effort (opus)
- Implementation, testing → STANDARD effort (sonnet)
- Override with /zibe-model and /zibe-effort. Check with /zibe-enforcement.
